# Technical Investigation: Full-Text Search Databases

## Introduction

I recently joined a new project facing performance and scaling issues. After a thorough analysis, our team lead asked me to investigate the possibility of using a different database for full-text searching to improve performance. This document provides an investigation of three potential solutions: Elasticsearch, Solr, and Lucene.

## Elasticsearch

### Overview
Elasticsearch is a distributed search and analytics engine optimized for speed and relevance on production-scale workloads. Elasticsearch is the foundation of Elasticâ€™s open Stack platform. Search in near real-time over massive datasets, perform vector searches, integrate with generative AI applications, and much more.It is designed for scalability and real-time search capabilities. It uses a RESTful API, making it easy to integrate with various applications.

### Key Features
- **Full-text search capabilities:** Powerful and flexible text analysis.
- **Distributed and scalable:** Handles large volumes of data across multiple nodes.
- **Real-time search:** Near real-time indexing and searching.
- **RESTful API:** Simple interaction via HTTP/JSON.
- **Advanced analytics:** Aggregations for complex data analysis.

### Performance
Elasticsearch is designed for high performance and can index and search large volumes of data quickly. It uses a distributed architecture to scale horizontally by adding more nodes, and it includes built-in optimizations like caching and efficient data structures.

### Use Cases
- Log and event data analysis (e.g., ELK stack: Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana).
- E-commerce product search.
- Full-text search in various applications.

## Solr

### Overview
Solr is the popular, blazing fast open source search platform for all your enterprise, e-commerce, and analytics needs, built on Apache Lucene. It is known for its advanced text analysis and distributed search capabilities through SolrCloud.

### Key Features
- **Full-text search capabilities:** Advanced text analysis.
- **Distributed and scalable:** Supports distributed indexing and searching via SolrCloud.
- **Faceted search:** Built-in faceting support.
- **Highly configurable:** Configurations through XML and API.
- **Community support:** Backed by Apache Software Foundation.


### Running Solr
Installing Solr

The Reference Guide contains an entire Deployment Guide to walk you through installing Solr.

###Running Solr in Docker

You can run Solr in Docker via the official image. Learn more about Solr in Docker

### Running Solr on Kubernetes
Solr has official support for running on Kubernetes, in the official Docker image. Please refer to the Solr Operator home for details, tutorials and instructions.


### Performance
Solr offers powerful caching and replication features. SolrCloud enables distributed indexing and search, facilitating horizontal scaling. It is optimized for high throughput and low latency.

### Use Cases
- Enterprise search applications.
- Content management systems.
- E-commerce and data-driven applications.

## Lucene

### Overview
Lucene is a full-text search library written in Java. It is highly customizable and flexible, making it suitable for building custom search solutions.

### Key Features
- **Full-text search capabilities:** Rich text analysis and indexing features.
- **Customizability:** Highly customizable and flexible.
- **Embedded:** Can be embedded in applications for custom search implementations.


## Building
### Basic steps:

    Install OpenJDK 21.
    Clone Lucene's git repository (or download the source distribution).
    Run gradle launcher script (gradlew).




### Performance
Lucene offers high core indexing and searching performance but requires significant effort to scale. It lacks out-of-the-box distributed capabilities and is often used as a building block for other search engines like Elasticsearch and Solr.

### Use Cases
- Building custom search solutions.
- Embedded search in desktop applications.
- Foundation for higher-level search platforms like Elasticsearch and Solr.

## Comparison and Recommendation

### Performance and Scalability
Elasticsearch and Solr both offer distributed capabilities for high performance and scalability. Elasticsearch is considered easier to set up and scale due to its distributed nature and RESTful API, while Solr provides similar capabilities but may require more configuration and tuning.

### Ease of Use
Elasticsearch has a straightforward REST API, making integration easy. Solr requires more configuration but offers extensive customizability.

### Community and Support
Elasticsearch is backed by Elastic.co, offering both community and commercial support, along with extensive plugins and integrations. Solr, an Apache project, relies more on community support.

### Specific Use Cases
For scalable, easy-to-integrate solutions with robust analytics and real-time capabilities, Elasticsearch is often the best choice. For highly configurable and faceted search platforms, Solr is a good fit. For custom search solutions, Lucene provides powerful capabilities but requires more effort to implement and scale.

### Recommendation
Based on performance and ease of use, Elasticsearch is the preferred choice for modern applications requiring full-text search capabilities, distributed architecture, and real-time analytics. Its robust community and commercial support add to its appeal for enterprise applications.
